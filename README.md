Installation
To get started, you’ll need a Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, WSL for Windows, etc.) with Bash installed. Most systems have Bash by default.

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bash-scripts.git
Navigate to the scripts folder:
bash
Copy code
cd bash-scripts
Make the scripts executable (if they aren't already):
bash
Copy code
chmod +x script-name.sh
Usage
Each script is self-contained and can be run directly from the command line. To use any of the scripts:

Navigate to the script's directory:

bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/script
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
./script-name.sh
Some scripts may require specific arguments. To see how to use a script, run the script with the --help flag or check the script's header for usage instructions.

Tips:
Be clear and concise: Write the README with users in mind. They should be able to understand what the repository is for and how to get started quickly.
Document your scripts: Each script should have a header comment explaining what the script does, its arguments, and any dependencies.
